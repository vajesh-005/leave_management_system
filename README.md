🗓️ Leave Management System
A web-based Leave Management System designed to streamline the leave request and approval process within an organization. This application ensures efficient communication between employees and their reporting authorities—Manager, HR, and Director—while maintaining transparency and accountability.

🔧 Project Overview
This system is currently under development and aims to provide the following core functionalities:

Admin-controlled user onboarding: Admins (typically HR) can add new users with assigned roles such as Employee, Manager, HR, or Director, along with mappings to their respective Manager, HR, and Director.

User authentication and role-based redirection: After logging in with valid credentials, users are redirected to role-specific dashboards.

👤 Features for Employees

Submit new leave requests.

Track approval progress (Approved / Rejected / Pending).

🧑‍💼 Features for Managers, Directors, and HR

Approve or reject leave requests based on rules and responsibilities.

🔐 Authentication & Roles

Only HR/Admin can create users and assign roles along with their reporting hierarchy.
